# Automated Data Analytics on AWS

The Automated Data Analytics on AWS solution provides an end-to-end data platform for ingesting, transforming, managing and querying datasets. This helps analysts and business users manage and gain insights from data without deep technical experience using Amazon Web Services (AWS). It has an open-sourced architecture with connectors to commonly used AWS services, along with third-party data sources and services. This solution also provides an user interface (UI) to search, share, manage, and query datasets using standard SQL commands.

## Architecture overview

The following diagram represents the solution's architecture design.

![Diagram](source/images/solution_architecture_diagram.png)

The Automated Data Analytics on AWS solution automates the building of data pipelines that are optimized for the size, frequency of update, and type of data. These data pipelines handle the data ingestion, transformations, and queries.

The Automated Data Analytics on AWS solution creates and integrates a combination of AWS services required to perform these tasks, abstracted through a user interface. These services include AWS Glue crawlers, jobs, workflows and triggers, along with S3 buckets, IAM integration, and other services. Additionally, the solution automatically detects and redacts personally identifiable information (PII) with granular security and governance controls.

For more information on the solutionâ€™s architecture, refer to the [implementation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/automated-data-analytics-on-aws/architecture-overview.html).

## Deploying the solution

Before you begin, ensure that:

- The solution has been built and all unit tests have passed as described in the [Build and run unit tests](#build-and-run-the-unit-tests) section.
- You have configured the computer used to deploy the solution with the correct AWS credentials to access the AWS account that Automated Data Analytics on AWS solution will be deployed to.

1. Set the deployment region `export AWS_REGION=<region-id>`. For a list of supported AWS region, refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/auotmated-data-analytics-on-aws/design-considerations.html
2. Make sure the current directory is in `automated-data-analytics-on-aws/source`
3. Deploy the Automated Data Analytics on AWS solution:
   - To deploy the Automated Data Analytics on AWS solution with its default security settings, use the command below:
     `yarn deploy-solution --parameters adminEmail="<Your email address>" --parameters adminPhoneNumber="<Your mobile number for MFA>"`
   - If the deployment is for evaluation purposes and does not contain any sensitive data, the default Multi-factor Authentication(MFA) feature can be set to `optional` to simplify the process. If this is preferred, use the following command for deployment:
     `yarn deploy-solution --parameters adminEmail="<Your email address>" --parameters adminMFA='OPTIONAL' --parameters advancedSecurityMode='OFF'`

The deployment may take up to 60 minutes to complete. During deployment the temporary password for the root administrator will be sent via email to the specified _adminEmail_. The email address and temporary password received in email can be used to log into the Automated Data Analytics on AWS solution for the initial setup.

After the solution has been deployed, the CDK returns the following information. Using this information, follow the steps to access the Automated Data Analytics on AWS solution.

> **Note**: To view the information returned by CDK from the AWS CloudFormation Console, navigate to the **Ada** stack and select the **Outputs** section.

```
Outputs:
Ada.AthenaProxyApiUrl = example.cloudfront.net:443
Ada.BaseApiUrl = https://example.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/prod/
Ada.CognitoUserPoolId = ap-southeast-2_Example
Ada.ExportNamespaceGlobalUUID = example
Ada.RetainedResourcesExport = ["arn:aws:kms:ap-southeast-2:123456789012:key/5dad9516-0007-4993-a613-example","arn:aws:kms:ap-southeast-2:123456789012:key/21d45985-6c92-41e9-a762-example","arn:aws:s3:::ada-dataproductservicestack752cb9-databucket-hash","arn:aws:s3:::ada-dataproductservicestack752-scriptsbucket-hash","arn:aws:s3:::ada-dataproductservicestack-fileuploadbucket-hash"]
Ada.UserPoolClientId = example
Ada.WebsiteUrl = https://example1234.cloudfront.net/
```

- `AthenaProxyApiUrl`: The URL for connecting Automated Data Analytics on AWS with Tableau / PowerBI via JDBC/ODBC.
- `BasedApiUrl`: Rest API URL.
- `CognitoUserPoolId`: Cognito User Pool id.
- `ExportNamespaceGlobalUUID`: A global unique identifier specific to this deployment.
- `RetainedResourcesExport`: A list of AWS Resources ARNs for which the resources will be retained if this solution is uninstalled (tore down) from the web console with retaining data or tore down from AWS CloudFormation Console.
- `UserPoolClientId`: Cognito user pool app client id
- `WebsiteUrl`: Automated Data Analytics on AWS web UI URL

## Accessing the solution web UI

1. Open `WebsiteUrl` in your browser. We recommend using Chrome. You will be redirected to the sign in page that requires username and password.
2. Sign in with the email address specified during deployment as username and use the temporary password received via email after deployment. Note that the sender of the temporary password email is `no-reply@verificationemail.com`.
3. During the sign in, you are required to set a new password when signing in for the first time. If the solution is deployed with MFA enabled, the MFA code is sent to the mobile number specified as _AdminPhone_ as a text message and you will need the MFA code for signing in.
4. After signing in, you can view the Automated Data Analytics on AWS web UI. The current user is the _root administrator_ user who has the highest level of permission for Automated Data Analytics on AWS. We recommend you keep these credentials secure.

We recommend using an external OpenID Connect or SAML 2.0 compatible identity provider to manage your users who need access to Automated Data Analytics on AWS. If there is an existing enterprise Identity Provider, you can integrate it with Automated Data Analytics on AWS. The root administrator user can set it up by accessing `Admin -> Identity Provider` in the Automated Data Analytics on AWS Web UI.

For more information on how to set up your Identity Provider, refer to the [implementation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/automated-data-analytics-on-aws/using-the-automated-data-analytics-on-aws-solution.html#identity-providers)

## Uninstalling the solution

You can uninstall the solution either from the Automated Data Analytics on AWS web UI or by directly deleting the stacks from the AWS CloudFormation console.

To uninstall the solution from the Automated Data Analytics on AWS web UI:

1. Open Automated Data Analytics on AWS web UI and login with the root administrator user details.
2. On the left navigation panel, click `Admin -> TearDown`
   > **Note**: Using the Teardown page, you can permanently remove the Automated Data Analytics on AWS solution from your account. The Teardown option is only available for users with <i>root_admin</i> access.
3. From the Teardown page, choose one of these following actions:
   - **Delete solution** â€“ This will uninstall all the resources associated with the solution but retain the imported data.
   - **Delete solution and data** â€“ This will uninstall all the resources associated with the solution and destroy the imported data.
4. Follow the link displayed on the web UI to AWS CloudFormation Console to monitor all Automated Data Analytics on AWS stacks to be deleted.

**Note**: If you chose to retain data, the data buckets and KMS keys for the data buckets will be retained.

To uninstall the solution from AWS CloudFormation console:

1. Go to the AWS CloudFormation console, and on the **Stacks** page, filter by stack name _ada-dp-_ to get list of dynamic infrastructure created for each Data Product.
2. Navigate to your `Ada` stack, and check its Output section, note down the value of the key `RetainedResourcesExport` and copy it to a text file to keep. These resources are retained after the main Automated Data Analytics on AWS stack is deleted.
3. In AWS CloudFormation console page, select the **Ada** stack and select **Delete**. Wait until all Automated Data Analytics on AWS nested stacks and main stack are deleted completely.
4. The data buckets and the KMS keys to encrypted data in them are retained (as listed out in `RetainedResourcesExport`). You can migrate data out of these buckets.
5. After the migration is completed, navigate to the AWS S3 console, choose each bucket, empty it and delete it for all the buckets that were listed in the `RetainedResourcesExport` file.
6. After deleting the buckets, navigate to AWS KMS Console and delete the two KMS keys that were listed in the `RetainedResourcesExport` file.
