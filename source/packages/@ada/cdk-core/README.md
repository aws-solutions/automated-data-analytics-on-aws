# cdk-core

This package defines common modules utlized by the solution infrastructure packages for [AWS Development Kit (CDK)](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) that are considered agnostic to the solution itself.

In general, modules in this package can be considered for broader open-source use in other CDK projects and may eventually be extracted into a separate project/library to enable reuse.
