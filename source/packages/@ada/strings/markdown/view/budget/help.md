Admins can create a Budget with a cost limit to track costs and usage, and receive notifications.

Enter budget limit value. Enter a list of subscriber email addresses who will get notified when the thresholds are hit. Set percentage threshold values for notifications and the subscribers will be notified when the current spend is greater than these percentages of the budget limit.
