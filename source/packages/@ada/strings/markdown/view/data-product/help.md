Use the Data Products landing page to view, create business domains or data products. 

**Notes:**
- Each data product must belong to a single domain.
- You can share queries and transformations within the same domain.

Using this page, you can:

- **Create Domain** - Domain name needs to be unique and only alphanumeric characters or underscores (_) are allowed. It must start with a letter, and can have a maxmimum length of 256 characters.
- **Delete Domain** - Select the domain to delete. Ensure all data products and queries shared within the domain are deleted before deleting a domain. The current solution version does not support cascade deletion, so you will need to delete all associated data products before you delete the domain.
