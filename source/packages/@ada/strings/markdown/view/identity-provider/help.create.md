You can connect to your IdP to provide federated access to authorized users.

On the Create Identity page, enter a name and description for the IdP along with any additional identifiers.

Automated Data Analytics on AWS offers four options of authentication providers:

- [SAML 2.0](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-saml-idp.html),
- [OIDC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-identity-provider.html#cognito-user-pools-oidc-providers),
- [Amazon](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-identity-federation.html), and
- [Google](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-user-pools-identity-federation.html).

After you configure your IdP, you can map user attributes with the corresponding Cognito User Pools.
