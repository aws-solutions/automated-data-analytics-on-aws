Using the Teardown page, you can permanently remove the Automated Data Analytics on AWS solution from your account.

**Note**: The Teardown option is only available for users with `root_admin` access.

From the Teardown page, you can choose one of these following actions:

- **Delete solution** – This will uninstall all the resources associated with the solution but retain the imported data.
- **Delete solution and data** – This will uninstall all the resources associated with the solution and destroy the imported data.

After confirming one of the actions, you will be presented with details on what resources will be retained, if any, and links to the AWS CloudFormation stacks being deleted.
